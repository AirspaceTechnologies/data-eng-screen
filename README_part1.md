# Data Engineer Screening – Scenario & Discussion

## Scenario

Business stakeholders are asking for data from [Aviation Stack](https://aviationstack.com/documentation) to be available via internal self-service BI tooling. This data will allow for performance tracking and monitoring of our different airline partners.

## Discussion Prompts

We'd like you to walk us through your approach to this request. Please discuss the following:

- **Requirements Gathering:**  
  - What clarifying questions would you ask stakeholders before starting?

- **Tradeoffs & Considerations:**  
  - What tradeoffs do you see in terms of data freshness, cost, complexity, and reliability?
  - How would you balance speed of delivery vs. robustness?

- **Architecture Design:**  
  - Verbally outline your proposed end-to-end data pipeline.
  - What technologies and tools would you use at each stage, and why?
  - How would you ensure data quality, security, and scalability?

- **Operational Concerns:**  
  - How would you monitor and alert on pipeline failures?
  - What would your testing strategy look like?
